## Hi, I’m Alan Colvin 👋

I’m a 26-year-old software developer based in the US.

Currently working on **NEXUM** — a privacy-first anti-detection browser focused on isolation, control, and transparency.

This is a solo project at an early stage.  
I’m prioritizing architecture, security, and long-term maintainability over fast releases.

### What I’m working on
- Browser session isolation
- Fingerprint control & stabilization
- Local-first encrypted storage
- Threat modeling & security design

### Current focus
- Designing a clean, auditable core
- Avoiding black-box behavior
- Building something I would trust myself

I believe good infrastructure is built slowly and honestly.
